# j40p
	embeddable http message parser for supporting more flexible and free application design. for now , it is 185kb in size.
	believed that  saved the half time of use to Xml compiling time.


"j40p" stand for : 32 years old <__Johnny__> wish it would be generally <__Premium__> in compensation for his earlier work while he continuously inevitably approaching his age <40> .

it take the author 6 years to get this far,  and approximately  100,000 USD in Cost, i have great hope that i can recover  my cost in a short time ,better less than a mainland Chinese life time span.

in the meantime, i wanna to find a job, however , i developed job phobia due to last job experience.and  psychotherapy is too expensive that i can't not afford it, so i just talk here like i am in treatment session .

and the hr kind of tough enough to spot the mentally unstable asset... just by asking " why/how do leave you last job?" , i know there always tougher hr that  would spill hot water to test the whether subject have what it takes to be qualified... just incase there are HRs who really wanna to know all the details of what happen in my second last job, please refer to the story  below  ,section year 2012-2014. over all , i summarize my phobia like this : if you ask the employer 5 coin for salary, they would  find a perfect man exploit all the method to beat 11 coin out of you,  the  more you ask , the harder you get beaten ... and the hit man alway serve a higher value than you , 6 out of 11 kind of more valuable than your labour... no matter what the industry is, you can only know that those people are very serious ... serious like they have cest all the money making industry from street to street for a very long time... they do thing like family....

 

my story:

	year 2005, learn the concept of <__xml/xslt xml/schema__> from w3cshool.
	  
	    wonder if there any xml editor that guide the composition of  xml data instance base on xml/schema. cause as a WebPage designer/engineer , the html is very labor intensive task. 
    
	year 2007 learn java.
	    don't like jsp at all. as a open source software User/secondary development developer, the config file for different app is nightmare. by then , my job is project implementation base on IBM Tivoli Software Suite .
	    
	    
	year 2009 , laid off by villainous 1st company,  quite on 2nd company ,seems known enough to try to write my own web server which would not adopt xml as config file, even start my own company .
	  
	    1. i am a very  well-executed javascript programmer;
	    
	    2. i know how to use RegularExpression. i know about NFA ,i know about DFA ; 
	    
	    3. i know how http protocol works, may be not very much in detail , but i think it is enough for my goal;
	    
	    4. Ajax +  web server designed my own could be good;
	    
	    5. i know how javascript closure/variable scope  works;
	    
	    
	    then , it try to use  java RegularExpression + <if/else control follow > to impliment my web server for better serving browser side javascript code developing. the code growing like a cancer and not sign for it would ever work. i was stucked.
	    
	    meanwhile ,the network in mainland ,China kind of blocked ... not very convenient for googling web result, can't access youtube either. such inconvenience redirect my anger towards such inhumane policy.

	year 2010, 2011, googling very hard on NFA,DFA head first material,
		NFA can convert to DFA, 
		machine only run DFA(more faster),
		DFA optimization is about NP-Hard.
		dead end.




	year 2012, 2013, 2014 ,
		find a job at Patear-Tibco offshore labor outsourcing CDC,BeiJing,mainland,China. developed:
		Message-Queue implementation facilitated by  Activspace.
		
		activspace_monitoring_for_hawk_ami(standalone process)
		activspace_monitoring_for_hawk_plugin(co-proces with Hawk)
		activspace_monitoring_for_JMX
		3 Adapter, 1 MonitoringLogic Driver implementation. facilitated by  java reflection,  take 3 iteration to polish The API and  metadata gathering framework design.
		
		the boss which i reported to , express in email with me that, he and the Client-Enterprise he represented by, don't  wanna "any invention" , by the "only invention" invented by the right people. thank god , my code have been released with new version of the Activspace, the Boss must pull a lot of connections, this is kind of a favor to me. otherwise i have done nothing but receiving daily payment.
		
		Configuration Data store base on activspace, run into squaro with  the  Pactera side team leader who interrupt me 3 times per sentence every time whenever the the boss not at presence . and accused me have done nothing in the  teleconference with remote boss.
		
		he basically rejected the idea that the configuration data store is a Map alike facility just like Java Property file.
		
		well , first , that is the common sense /practice , and the decision is made by the Client/Boss.
		
		and i am not going to develop  a file system, or ldap server in just 2 week and call it as Configuration Data Store.
		
		instead learning the feature of the developed config store, he kept accusing me to the team member that i betrayed the Team.
		
		by the boss arriving at BeiJing CDC , he yet don't know the configstore is rich in Type contrast with Java property  file. he think it just a HashMap<String,String>  ...
		
		boss yelling at him whole the afternoon until the 6:00PM , ask me in to confront him and the team , base on the the ordeal they just experienced ,and i don't been informed that the boss was going yelling at him , i only suggest that : " it is better that if team members can have conversation without bothering the Client every time."
		
		the Client play the Bad guy , i play the good guy, i don't know whether the Client secretly hate me , but i do know that , after the Yelling incident , the  team lead and the Client /Boss do bonded. and i loss my only change to make the confrontation to  state it all business, nothing personal. the ideal conversation pattern not  been  established ... since the , the team leader , interrupt me 3 more times per sentence and with the opening remarks: " by the request of Client/Boss, i  speak with you..." ---- all outputs ,no inputs ,now wonder he don't know any feature developed by anybody.  and the  design idea is  always on his mouth, never on paper,, always labeled with " your let me finish first,you listen to me first" in between your  single sentence .
		
		despite the type rich config store,  he just use String Type for all value, then he just used 2 month proving that , the map alike config store  can't support large key set, it should be a file system....
		
		Client/Boss , in the mail state that : " it wrong only use only String, but let it be,  time is the essence  "----- like i said , bonded. refuse my proposal to develop  the the config store from  back end the front end. later , Client /Boss later assign him more human resource. 
		
		like i am the badge for his laziest design , and pretending at work,  whatever he do , i sabotage the whole project, he famous API design:  
		String do_you_wanna_me_to_sucess+do_you_wanna_me_to_fail(String you_hear_me_first );
		
		
		however , he sell the shit very well , Client/Boss is bonded with him. he always has the  time to secure the Job and position and title,  and i can only do my best to secure the project which i can control with...
		

	year 2015 :
		since  the protocol  parsing  can not modeling with regular expression ,NFA,DFA, it can be model as PAD(pushdown automaton)
		
		i found the site :   Finite State Machine Designer
		http://madebyevan.com/fsm/
		
		directly  drawing , DFA out, and use  nested "switch control flow block" along with various  class field state,  implemented  the 
		xml alike parser and http client message  parser.
